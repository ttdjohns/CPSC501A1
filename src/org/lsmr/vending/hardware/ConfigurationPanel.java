/**
 * A panel on the interior of the machine that a maintenance person can, in
 * principle, use to set the product costs. The logic for interpreting button
 * presses is not built into the device.
 * <p>
 * The panel has 37 buttons for data entry (which can be used to code a small
 * set of numbers and characters, plus a "shift" key). It has an additional
 * designated button to indicate "Enter". It also has a small display to provide feedback
 * to the maintainer.
 * <p>
 * Note that no listeners and no code interpreter are added automatically.
 * Different code interpreters will be needed for different kinds of vending
 * machine.
